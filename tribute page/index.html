				The Indian Armed Forces
			</h2>
            
			<p style="font-size: 19px;" >
				 ü™ñ The Indian Army is the land-based part of the Indian military. 
                    It is one of the biggest armies in the world. 
                    Its main job is to protect India and keep it safe. 
                    The army has a long history and was created when India was under British rule. 
                    After India became independent, the army became the country's main military force.
                <br><br>
                ü™ñ  The army is led by the Chief of Army Staff, who is a top general. It is divided into different parts called commands, which take care of specific areas. Inside these commands, there are smaller groups like divisions, brigades, and battalions.
                <br><br>
                ü™ñThe Indian Army has a lot of soldiers‚Äîaround 1.4 million people. There is also a reserve force of trained personnel who can be called upon when needed. The army has been involved in many operations and missions over the years, including wars with Pakistan and fighting against insurgencies within the country. It also helps the United Nations with peacekeeping missions around the world.
                <br><br>
                ü™ñBesides its main role in defense, the army also helps during disasters and emergencies. It provides assistance with things like rescue operations, medical aid, and helping people affected by natural disasters.

				ARMY HEROES AND THEIR TALES OF BRAVERY
			</h2>
            <h3>1.Captain Vikram Batra</h3>
            <img src="https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2015/12/army1.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" class="center"/>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" style="text-align: center;" >
                Born in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Captain Vikram Batra of 13 J&K Rifles, is known as the hero of the Kargil war. He led one of the toughest war operations in Kashmir, and was also called Sher Shah (in the intercepted messages of the Pakistani army).
               <br><br>
               He was instrumental in recapturing Peak 5140, which is located at an altitude of 17,000 feet. During this mission, Batra was seriously injured but still managed to kill three enemy soldiers in close combat. After capturing Peak 5140, he went on yet another difficult mission to recapture Peak 4875 on July 7, 1999. Batra made a call to his father before he left and told him about the crucial mission. Hardly did he know that this would be his last call home.
               <br><br>
           </p>
           <h3>2. Major General Ian Cardozo</h3>
           <img src="https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2015/12/army2.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" class="center"/>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" style="text-align: center;" >
                Major General Ian Cardozo, who has many achievements to his name, will always be known for his immense courage in the 1971 war with Pakistan. He was, at the time, a young major with 5 Gorkha Rifles. During the war, he stepped on a landmine and severely injured his leg. When even the doctor could not cut his leg, Cardozo asked for a khukri (the Gorkha knife) and cut his own leg off, saying, ‚ÄúNow go and bury it!‚Äù
               <br><br>
           </p>
          <h3> 3. Brigadier Mohammad Usman</h3>
           <img src="https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2015/12/army3.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" class="center"/>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" style="text-align: center;" >
                Born in Bibipur, Uttar Pradesh, this man of steel joined the Indian army in 1934. During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947/48, Brigadier Usman repulsed a fierce attack on Naushera and Jhangar, two highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and was named by his fellow soldiers ‚ÄòThe Lion of Naushera.‚Äô
                At the time of the Partition, he was made the offer of becoming the Chief of the Pakistani Army but he chose to stay in India. He left the Baloch regiment of Pakistan and was inducted into the Dogra regiment in India. After the Battle of Naushera, where the Pakistanis suffered heavy casualties at his hands, the same country that had courted him to become the chief of the army, now went ahead and placed prize money of Rs. 50,000 on his head.
               <br><br>
           </p>

           <h3> 4.Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan</h3>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;" style="text-align: center;" >
                Sandeep Unnikrishnan (15 March 1977 ‚Äì 28 November 2008) was an officer in theIndian Army serving in the elite Special Action Group of the National Security Guards. He was killed in action during theNovember 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was consequently awarded the Ashoka Chakra, India‚Äôs highest peace time gallantry award, on 26 January 2009.
               <br><br>
           </p>

           <h3> 5.Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav</h3>
           <img src="https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2015/12/army4.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" class="center"/>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" style="text-align: center;" >
                This brave soldier has the high honour of being the youngest recipient of the Param Vir Chakra. He received this award at the age of 19 for his actions on July 4,1999, during the Kargil war.
               <br><br>
               He was climbing the high cliff with the help of a rope when the enemy bunker started rocket fire. Yadav was hit by three bullets in his groin and shoulder. Despite being severely injured, Yadav kept climbing and finished the remaining 60 feet to reach the top of the cliff. Though in immense pain, Yadav crawled to the first enemy bunker and lobbed a grenade, which killed four Pakistani soldiers and set back the enemy fire. 
               During the second part of the fight, a few more bullets hit Yadav. Some say he was hit by 16 bullets, some say less, but he survived it all. Yadav‚Äôs heroic actions were portrayed in the film, Lakshya, by actor Hrithik Roshan.
